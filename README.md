# AutoML Web Application ðŸ”ŽðŸ”Ž
An End-to-End Machine Learning Web Application for processing Classification problems which, for a dataset from the user, performs data cleaning, data preprocessing, classification and optimization of hyperparameters for classification algorithms and displays the best algorithm and its values.

Currently supported for csv and excel files. The application relies on these two excellent libraries for machine learning:
 * Streamlit: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit
 * Pycaret: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret

## Features
### 1. Upload the Dataset
  * Drag and drop your csv file.
  * Assign your target variable.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis options:
  * Show shape.
  * Show data type.
  * Show missing values
  * Description
  * Show columns
  * Show selected columns
  * Show Correlation Heatmap
  * Show Value Counts
  * Show Unique Values
  * Show ydata profiling
    
### 3. Data Cleaning options:
* Remove duplicates
* Drop specific columns
* Handle missing data
  * Drop Missing Values (Drop all rows with Nan values, Drop all columns with Nan values)
  * Missing Values Imputation (Mean Imputation, Median Imputation, Most frequent Imputation, Random Imputation)

### 4. Data Preprocessing options:
* Scale your dataset (MinMaxScaler)
* Encode your dataset (Label Encoder, One Hot Encoder, Ordinal Encoder)
* Balance your dataset (Over Sampling, Under Sampling, Combined)

### 5. Model Training preforms:
* Training and Comparing all available Machine Learning Algorithm automatically.
* Hyperparameter tuning for 5 best models and Comparing them.
* Returning the best model.
* Best Model Result Visualization (plots)
* Save whole Machine Learning Pipeline of the best model as pickle file.
